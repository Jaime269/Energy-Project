# Energy-Project

The objective of this project is create an api caller for BMRS Imbalance Prices (B1770) and Aggregated Imbalance Volumes (B1780) from www.elexon.co.uk.

After pulling the data I have created a process to analysis  the data selecting the desired day, creating a report and sharing it to the stakeholders involved in the project by email.

Thank you for your time!

Regards,

Jaime
